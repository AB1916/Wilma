# Microprocessor Lab Final Project 'Bop It'
Repository for Physics Year 3 microprocessors lab for final project of group G1b.

An  assembly program for PIC18 microprocessor to create the game Bop It.

Game revolves around using the correct input in the time given. The time given will decrease as the game progresses making it harder.

Generates a random number using a Linear Congruential Generator.

Random number lights up LEDs and determines what input is required.

A delay function gives the player time to input the correct input. If the incorrect input is entered or the player runs out of time the game will terminate.

A delay function that decreases throughout the game is used to make the game harder.
